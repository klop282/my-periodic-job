## Welcome to Ninjayoto's Github Page

Developer from Calgary, Alberta

### About me

I develop Android apps, and I create automated minions to test other developers code. 
And when my minions are not trolling any developers, they go out and do other tasks in my behalf, they scrape the web for info and take  action on their own.

### Projects

- [Teleporter](https://devpost.com/software/teleporter) :  a hackathon prize winning android app _Best New Getting Around Town App_ @ a Red Hat Hackathon end of 2017.
Basically using the app you take a photo of any landmark and it will return the name of the landmark, the nearest airport and the ticket price + a 360 panoramic photo of the location. This is made possible by using Google's Cloud Vision.

### Github repos

[I love github](https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github) and the wonderful platform it provides for the open-source community; few of my projects are hosted here, but private and work repos elsewhere.
