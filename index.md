## Welcome to Ninjayoto's Github Page

Developer from Calgary, Alberta

### About me

I develop Android apps, and I create automated minions to test other developers code. 
And when my minions are not trolling any developers, they go out and do other tasks in my behalf, they scrape the web for info and take  action on their own.

### Projects

- *Teleporter* an android app that won _Best New Getting Around Town App_ @ a Red Hat Hackathon end of 2017, basically using the app you take a photo of any landmark and it will return the name of the landmark, the nearest airport and the ticket price + a 360 panoramic photo of the location.

### Github repos

I love githib and the wonderful platform it provides for the open-source community; but because it provides free private repos, I host most of my personal work on GitLab.

But yoou can still find some of my older projects on github, and many forks of intresting projects:
