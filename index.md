## Welcome to Ninjayoto's Github Page

Developer from Calgary, Alberta

### About me

I develop Android apps, and I create automated minions to test other developers code. 
And when my minions are not trolling any developers, they go out and do other tasks in my behalf, they scrape the web for info and take  action on their own.

### Projects

- [Teleporter](https://devpost.com/software/teleporter) : 
Basically the app allows you to take or upload a photo of a landmark, and it will return the name of the landmark, the nearest airport and the cheapest ticket price to get there + a 360 panoramic photo of the area. This is made possible by using Google Cloud Vision AI Machine Learning.
This app won a hackathon prize for _Best New Getting Around Town App_ @ Red Hat OpenShift _Hack Your Travel_ Hackathon, end of 2017.

### Github repos

[I love github](https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github) and the wonderful platform it provides for the open-source community; few of my projects are hosted here, but private and work repos are hosted elsewhere.
